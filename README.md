# George-bookmarks-app
I can add bookmarks that contain: title, url link, description, and rating(1-5)
I can see all my bookmarks when I first open app which shows just the condensed view with title and rating
I can see the expanded view when the bookmark is clicked which incudes the description as well as "Visit Site" which links to the URL
I can remove bookmarks from my list
I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark
I can select a dropdown menu to filter my list by ratings at or above the selected rating
